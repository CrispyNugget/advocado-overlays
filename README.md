advocado-overlays
=================

##Background

Advocado is revising its overlays. The objectives:

* mobile compatibility and responsiveness
* better aesthetic to improve conversion, i.e. make people want to share more and get the discount

As such we have come up with a set of designs that we would like to convert into actual HTML/CSS. 

An actual demo of Advocado can be found [here](http://www.goodnightmacaroon.co/collections/biggest-christmas-sale/products/pea-coat-double-breasted). Click on the "Click for 20% Discount" button.

##Updates

* __Initial commit__
Okay, this might be a bit long, since it's supposed to log all the (correct/ completed) things that I've done.
